				<h1>Early life and background</h1>
				<p>Roshni was born in GhatoTand, Hazaribagh (now in Ramgarh), and she hails from a Hindu family. Her paternal village Mandu is  <br>also in the Ramgarh(now) District of Jharkhand. Roshni's parents moved from Mandu to GhatoTand, where her father Suresh Prasad<br> manages a Grocery Store. Roshni is a Single child so she gains lots of love from their parents. Roshni is a fan of<br> Madhawi Bilochan, and her childhood idols were cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan <br>and some tv serial Actrors and Actresses.

					Roshni studied at TATA DAV Public School, GhatoTand, Ramagrh, Jharkhand where she initially excelled<br> in Shotput and Discus Throw and was selected at district and club level in these sports. Roshni was a goalkeeper for his football team and was <br>sent to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. Though he had not played cricket, Dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping <br>skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995â€“1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was<br> picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and he performed well.[22] Dhoni focused on cricket after<br> his 10th standard.[25] He was a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, under South Eastern<br> Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.[26][27][28] His colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee <br>of the Indian Railways. But Dhoni also had a mischievous side to his personality. Once, while staying at the railway quarters, Dhoni and a <br>couple of his friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. The night guards were<br> fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. The story made big news on the next day.[29][30][31]
